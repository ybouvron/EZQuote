#### This explains how to download and uplod the image ####

The testCurl.cpp file is what will download and upload the image.

To run this, you will need to use make to compile create an executable file.
In the CMakeLists.txt file, the list of libraries are defined that is needed for OpenCV and C++ to run. 
This case, the excutable file is called "test". Change this to whatever you would like in the CMakeLists.txt file.

In order to download an image, you will need run as follows:
./test download
If you get an OpenCV error about size or is says "No image to download" then that means nothing is in queue on the server.

To upload the image, you will need run as follows:
./test upload
Depending on the size of the image, it may take up to 20 seconds for the image to upload to the server.
Once the image is uploaded, you will get an output image saying so.
